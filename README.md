# FnMacAssistant
Welcome to Fortnite Assistant! An easy to use assistant that helps you download the latest Fortnite IPA and applies the necessary patches for it to work properly.
<hr/>
<h2>Requirments:</h2> 
Have Sideloadly installed on your mac <br/>
Mac must be on MacOS 15.0 or later <br/>
A mac with an M series chip. (Fortnite mobile will never work on an Intel Mac)

<hr/>

**note:** The game can be played with keyboard and mouse, but a controller is needed to login and to interact with the lobby (ready up, select gamemode, change skin, etc.) 

**note 2:** The screen size will be in an iPad's screen size format, so you may see black bars on the edges of your screen. I haven't found a way to make the game fullscreen yet. 

If anyone manages to solve any of this two issues, open a request and I'll try to implement it!
<hr/>
Instructions:

1. download and install [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io)

2. Download the newest version of FnMacAssistant from [Releases](https://github.com/isacucho/FnMacAssistant/releases) and unzip it.
