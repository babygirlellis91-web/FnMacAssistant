<h2>Requirments:</h2> 
Have Sideloadly installed on your mac <br/>
Mac must be on MacOS 15.0 or later <br/>
A mac with an M series chip. (Fortnite mobile will never work on an Intel Mac)

<hr/>

**note:** The game can be played with keyboard and mouse, but a controller is needed to login and to interact with the lobby (ready up, select gamemode, change skin, etc.) 

~~**note 2:** The screen size will be in an iPad's screen size format, so you may see black bars on the edges of your screen. I haven't found a way to make the game fullscreen yet.~~ <br>
The Fortnite fullscreen patch is now live! Make sure to select the Fullscreen IPA when downloading with FnMasAssistant for it to work.

If anyone manages to solve the controller issue, open a request (or PM me on discord) and I'll try to implement it!

<h2>Instructions:</h2>

1. Download and install [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io)

2. Download the newest version of FnMacAssistant from [Releases](https://github.com/isacucho/FnMacAssistant/releases) and unzip it.

3. You should now have an app called FnMacAssistant on your downloads folder. Double-click to open it.

4. You will get a 'Could not verify' pop-up. That is because the app isn't lisenced by Apple. That would cost a fortune and it is not worth it. To open the app, go to _Settings > Privacy & Security_ and click on the _open anyway_ button.

5. Select the IPA version from the dropdown menu, and click the _Download IPA_ button to download it.

6. Go to sideloadly and sideload the downloaded IPA (the IPA will be saved to your _Downloads_ folder.

7. Return to FnMacAssistant and click on the _Patch App_ button. (This will patch the embedded.mobileprovision to _/Applications/Fortnite.app/Wrapper/FortniteClient-IOS-Shipping.app_)

8. Open fortnite and enjoy!
