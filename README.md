# FnMacAssistant
Welcome to Fortnite Assistant! An easy to use assistant that helps you download the latest Fortnite IPA and applies the necessary patches for it to work properly.
<hr/>
Requirments:

Have Sideloadly installed on your mac

Mac must be on MacOS 15.0 or later

A mac with an M series chip. (Fortnite mobile will never work on an Intel Mac)


note: The game can be played with keyboard and mouse, but a controller is needed to login and to interact with the lobby (ready up, select gamemode, change skin, etc.) 

note 2: The screen size will be in an iPad's screen size format, so you may see black bars on the edges of your screen. I haven't found a way to make the game fullscreen yet. 

If anyone manages to solve any of this two issues, open a request and I'll try to implement it!


Instructions:

1. download and install [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io)

2. Download the newest version of FnMacAssistant and unzip it.
